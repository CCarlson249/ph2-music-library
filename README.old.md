Description: This is a music library single page site built with react.js using the create-react-app. Users will be able to sort and filter through a song library through a search function by several different criteria (ex: album, title, artist, genre). Users will be able to look through the song library and find more details about songs by clicking on them. Users will be able to add more songs to the page and they will persist via our JSON server. They can also add more details about the song that will be stored on the server. Songs can also be deleted from the server.
